# PRODIGY_CS_Task03
Password Strength Checker is a Python security utility used to analyze and verify user-input passwords based on industry-standard cybersecurity guidelines. The primary objective of the tool is to assist users in generating strong and secure passwords by scanning for necessary security elements and delivering instant feedback.

This project verifies whether the input password satisfies basic security requirements like a minimum length of eight characters, an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character. It also examines the strength of the password as a whole and alerts the user if their password is weak, medium, or strong. When the password does not meet the specified requirements, the software provides clear indication of what is lacking, and it becomes easy for users to enhance the password.

Developed with Object-Oriented Programming in Python, this project has a clean, organized coding style that is ideal for new learners and beginners interested in learning security concepts as well as good coding practices. The script can be run on any system with Python 3.x and can be run directly from the terminal or command prompt.

This utility can be expanded in the future by including features like a GUI, browser-based implementation with Flask, and password strength visualiser. The project is perfectly suitable for practice in university, internships, learning about cybersecurity, and showing some basic software development skills.
